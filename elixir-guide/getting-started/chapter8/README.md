# Modules and Functions Chapter

This directory contains three examples of modules and functions in elixir. 

To run the modules with the extension `.ex` you write the following on the command line:
```
elixirc module.ex
```
After which, you may access the module within IEx.

The modules with the extension `.exs` are meant for scripting. To run them, you run the following on the command line:
```
elixir module.exs
```
